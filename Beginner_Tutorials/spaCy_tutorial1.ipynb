      "promote his advancement in the best manner that his profession might\n",
      "allow, and if he took orders, desired that a valuable family living\n",
      "might be his as soon as it became vacant.\n",

      "not think it unreasonable for him to expect some more immediate\n",
      "pecuniary advantage, in lieu of the preferment, by which he could not be\n",
      "benefited.\n",
      "he had some intention, he added, of studying the law, and i\n",

      "insufficient support therein.\n",
      "i rather wished than believed him to be\n",
      "sincere; but, at any rate, was perfectly ready to accede to his\n",
      "proposal.\n",
      "i knew that mr. wickham ought not to be a clergyman.\n",
      "the\n",
      "business was therefore soon settled.\n",

      "in the church, were it possible that he could ever be in a situation to\n",

      "to pemberley, or admit his society in town.\n",
      "in town, i believe, he\n",
      "chiefly lived, but his studying the law was a mere pretence; and being\n",
      "now free from all restraint, his life was a life of idleness and\n",
      "dissipation.\n",
      "for about three years i heard little of him; but on the\n",
      "decease of the incumbent of the living which had been designed for him,\n",
      "he applied to me again by letter for the presentation.\n",
      "his\n",
      "circumstances, he assured me, and i had no difficulty in believing it,\n",
      "were exceedingly bad.\n",
      "he had found the law a most unprofitable study,\n",
      "and was now absolutely resolved on being ordained, if i would present\n",
      "him to the living in question--of which he trusted there could be little\n",
      "doubt, as he was well assured that i had no other person to provide for,\n",
      "and i could not have forgotten my revered father’s intentions.\n",
      "you will\n",
      "hardly blame me for refusing to comply with this entreaty, or for\n",
      "resisting every repetition of it.\n",
      "his resentment was in proportion to\n",
      "the distress of his circumstances--and he was doubtless as violent in\n",
      "his abuse of me to others as in his reproaches to myself.\n",
      "after this\n",
      "period, every appearance of acquaintance was dropped.\n",
      "how he lived, i\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "they entered the woods, and, bidding adieu to the river for a while,\n",
      "ascended some of the higher grounds; whence, in spots where the opening\n",
      "of the trees gave the eye power to wander, were many charming views of\n",
      "the valley, the opposite hills, with the long range of woods\n",
      "overspreading many, and occasionally part of the stream.\n",
      "mr. gardiner\n",

      "beyond a walk.\n",
      "with a triumphant smile, they were told, that it was ten\n",
      "miles round.\n",
      "it settled the matter; and they pursued the accustomed\n",
      "circuit; which brought them again, after some time, in a descent among\n",
      "hanging woods, to the edge of the water, and one of its narrowest parts.\n",
      "\n",
      "they crossed it by a simple bridge, in character with the general air of\n",
      "the scene: it was a spot less adorned than any they had yet visited; and\n",
      "the valley, here contracted into a glen, allowed room only for the\n",
      "stream, and a narrow walk amidst the rough coppice-wood which bordered\n",
      "it.\n",
      "elizabeth longed to explore its windings; but when they had crossed\n",
      "the bridge, and perceived their distance from the house, mrs. gardiner,\n",
      "who was not a great walker, could go no farther, and thought only of\n",
      "returning to the carriage as quickly as possible.\n",
      "her niece was,\n",
      "therefore, obliged to submit, and they took their way towards the house\n",
      "on the opposite side of the river, in the nearest direction; but their\n",
      "progress was slow, for mr. gardiner, though seldom able to indulge the\n",
      "taste, was very fond of fishing, and was so much engaged in watching the\n",
      "occasional appearance of some trout in the water, and talking to the man\n",
      "about them, that he advanced but little.\n",
      "whilst wandering on in this\n",
      "slow manner, they were again surprised, and elizabeth’s astonishment was\n",
      "quite equal to what it had been at first, by the sight of mr. darcy\n",
      "approaching them, and at no great distance.\n",
      "the walk being here less\n",
      "sheltered than on the other side, allowed them to see him before they\n",
      "met.\n",
      "elizabeth, however astonished, was at least more prepared for an\n",
      "interview than before, and resolved to appear and to speak with\n",
      "calmness, if he really intended to meet them.\n",
      "for a few moments, indeed,\n",
      "she felt that he would probably strike into some other path.\n",
      "the idea\n",
      "lasted while a turning in the walk concealed him from their view; the\n",
      "turning past, he was immediately before them.\n",
      "with a glance she saw that\n",
      "he had lost none of his recent civility; and, to imitate his politeness,\n",
      "she began as they met to admire the beauty of the place; but she had not\n",
      "got beyond the words “delightful,” and “charming,” when some unlucky\n",
      "recollections obtruded, and she fancied that praise of pemberley from\n",
      "her might be mischievously construed.\n",
      "her colour changed, and she said\n",
      "no more.\n",
      "\n",

      "the introduction, however, was immediately made; and as she named their\n",

      "could from such disgraceful companions.\n",
      "that he was _surprised_\n",
      "by the\n",
      "connection was evident: he sustained it, however, with fortitude: and,\n",

      "conversation with mr. gardiner.\n",
      "elizabeth could not but be pleased,\n",
      "could not but triumph.\n",
      "it was consoling that he should know she had some\n",

      "she listened most\n",
      "attentively to all that passed between them, and gloried in every\n",

      "his taste, or his good manners.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",

      "time to supply him with fishing tackle, and pointing out those parts of\n",

      "wonder.\n",

      "compliment must be all for herself.\n",
      "her astonishment, however, was\n",
      "extreme; and continually was she repeating, “why is he so altered?\n",

After a guest role in Sex and the City, he made his film debut in the comedy Wet Hot American Summer (2001) and played Will Tippin in the television show Alias (2001–2006). He had his breakthrough in The Hangover (2009), which was followed by two sequels. Cooper found more success with Silver Linings Playbook (2012), American Hustle (2013), and American Sniper (2014), the last of which he also produced. Cooper wrote, produced, directed, and starred in A Star Is Born (2018). For his part in its soundtrack and its chart-topping lead single \"Shallow\", he won a BAFTA Award and two Grammys. Cooper continued his filmmaking with Joker (2019), Nightmare Alley (2021) and Maestro (2023), and also starred in the last two. He has received twelve Academy Award nominations. '"
